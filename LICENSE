i don't know really how lisences work, soooooo, you may:

1. edit this software
2. use this software in a project
3. post this software in a fourm or github, but only if it is indistinguishable from my orignal software (this goes for any of the versions, latest or not)

if you break any of this rules, feel SHAME!!! (because i can't really punish you XD)

Have Fun!
