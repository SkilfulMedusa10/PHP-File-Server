i don't know really how lisences work, soooooo, you may:

1. edit this software
2. use this software in a project
3. post this software in a fourm or github, but only if it is indistinguishable from my orignal software (this goes for any of the versions, latest or not)

if you break any of this rules, i only see 3 being able to be broken XD, feel SHAME!!! (because i can't really punish you lol)

Have Fun!
