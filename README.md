Hey!

So, this is a file server writen in PHP.
This will alow you to Upload, Download, Delete, and Change the Name of the files.

The files are stored in the "uploads" file.

I will be updateing this file with better CSS code, and an upload system to upload more then one file a once, but if you want to add to the code, please do!

If you use this code in a project, i'd ask that you'll include that i made this piece of software :>  

(by the way, i used apache for the server hosting, and notepad++ for editing(if that helps anyone :S(there really good peaces of sofware :>(10/10 would suggest!))))
